# BUilding-in-a-Day
Term project for Boston University CAS CS858. Comparing structure from motion across scenes

This various scripts used are contained in this repository as well as the report and powerpoint presentation for this project. 

Fully reconstructed datasets are too large to upload so only the raw images are in the datasets folder. 

Made use of the [OpenSfM](https://github.com/mapillary/OpenSfM) package
